# AstroQuantCipher
## Advanced File Encryption and Decryption Tool

THIS IS  A WORK IN PROGRESS!
This Python program provides state-of-the-art file encryption and decryption capabilities with advanced features, ensuring robust protection for your sensitive data.

## Features

* **Astronomical Random Number Generator:** Leverages the positions of Pluto and Mercury, combined with Pi, to generate truly unpredictable random values, significantly enhancing the cryptographic strength of the entire system, making it resistant to attacks that rely on predictable randomness. 
* **Triple Encryption:** Employs multiple layers of encryption using AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithms, providing enhanced security against brute-force attacks and cryptanalysis, ensuring your data remains confidential even if one layer is compromised.
* **Secure Deletion:** Overwrites original file data with random bytes before deletion, making it extremely difficult to recover the original content even with forensic tools, offering an additional layer of protection against unauthorized data recovery.
* **Windows Explorer Integration:** Allows you to install and uninstall right-click menu entries, enabling convenient encryption and decryption directly from Windows Explorer, streamlining your workflow and making file protection more accessible.
* **Argon2 Key Derivation:** Leverages the Argon2 key derivation function to generate strong encryption keys from your password, protecting against dictionary attacks and other password cracking techniques, ensuring the security of your encryption keys even with weak passwords. 
* **HMAC Integrity Check:** Utilizes HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) to ensure data integrity during decryption, preventing unauthorized modifications or tampering, providing assurance that your decrypted files haven't been altered.
* **Compression:** Compresses files using GZIP before encryption to reduce storage space and improve transmission speed, optimizing storage and network efficiency while maintaining strong encryption.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Requires a time-based one-time password (TOTP) generated by an external 2FA app, adding an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access even if your password is compromised, enhancing overall account protection.
* **Encrypted Audit Logging:** Maintains an encrypted log of all encryption and decryption operations for security auditing purposes, allowing you to track file access and identify any potential security breaches.
* **Filename Encryption:** Encrypts the filenames of encrypted files to provide additional privacy, obscuring sensitive information even from casual observation.
* **Multi-threading Support:** Utilizes multi-threading for improved performance on larger files, accelerating the encryption and decryption processes and making the tool more efficient for handling large datasets.
